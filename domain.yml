    \n\n Knight \n---------\n
    Knight with pure and righteous ways of the warrior. Having been trained for combat since a child,

    \n\n Dark Priest \n---------\n

    Hardened in the freezing winds of the north, outlander is an epitome of survival. He knows all the tricks to 
    stay alive even in the most impossible of situations.
